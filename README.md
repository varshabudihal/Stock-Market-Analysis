# Stock-Market-Analysis
In this project, I have analysed data from the stock market for some technology stocks.

Again, I have used Pandas to extract and analyse the information, visualise it, and look at different ways to analyse the risk of a stock, based on its performance history.

Here are a few questions to answer:

What was the change in a stockâ€™s price over time?
What was the daily return average of a stock?
What was the moving average of various stocks?
What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
How can we attempt to predict future stock behaviour?

Skills: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Financial Analysis
